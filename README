INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

To make the software work you will need a postgresql server version 9.1 or higher, and the data.txt file.

Please do the following steps IN ORDER
1 - Unzip the release in the folder of your choice
2 - Check in the application.conf file that the values to connect to your instance of postgresql are correct. Adjust if needed.
3 - Start the Postgresql server. I used the default port 5432.
4 - In the bin folder, create a folder named "data" and put the unzipped data.txt file on it. The Path of the file should look like this: c:\<yourfolder>\hep-1.0-SNAPSHOT\bin\data\data.txt
5 - In the bin folder, launch hep or hep.bat depending on the OS.

Go to the url "http://localhost:9000/tests". If all the tests have the value true, then you are ready to go and can start browsing at the address http://localhost:9000.
If one line ends with "false", then one dependency has not been found and the website is not functional.
In the event that the databse server is not running, the screen will be filled with a play stacktrace indicating that a connection could not be made.

KNOWN BUGS/PROBLEMS

- The Polyfill for local datetime inputs does not work on chrome. Works on firefox, IE. Not enough time to fix this :(, sry.
- F5 during import will show the play button instead of the pause button
- The count(*) request is horrendously slow using postgresql.
- Javascript and css files are not minifed/obfuscated
- Graphs do not fetch the data from the DB if you only change granularity. This is by design, but can be misleading during import.
- The years you can choose from is populated either on page load, or if empty on first click and does not get refreshed after. Same misleading beahavior as above.

TECHNICAL CHOICES

Play has:
 - a known hierarchy of files, to makes reading code easier
 - a built-in packaging system
 - a built-in http server
 - a websocket handler
 - an ORM (not really used but still)
 - not been used on one of my previous projects. I like to learn.

NOTES

If this was really a final client I would have said to him that there is not enough time to do the project. And probably a boring thing like a servlet on tomcat.
I tried to chose the best balance between number of features, quality of code, and fun; I hope you agree with my choices.
